# Python_Topcat_Redshift_Obtain
Code for obtaining redshift from another catalogue via Topcat match

This folder contains the codes used to match between 2 
fields where one of them has the redshift info. The
codes require Topcat in order to work.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE CODES ARE RATHER PARTICULAR IN
THEIR USE BUT THEY CAN BE USED AS A REFERENCE FOR FURTHER CODING.
